## TEST_CONFIGS are the butler toml's that are to be retrieved
TEST_CONFIGS=(http://localhost/toml/butler1.toml https://localhost/toml/butler1.toml https://localhost/toml/butler2.toml https://127.0.0.1/toml/butler2.toml https://localhost/toml/butler3.toml https://localhost/

host/toml/butler10.toml file:///www/toml/butler11.toml)

## TEST_RESPONSES are the unix return code that should be recieved by butler for each config. the seqence of the number in the array should match up w/ the expected respose of the config in TEST_CONFIGS
TEST_RESPONSES=(1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0)
ITER=0

    $cmd -test
    res=$?
